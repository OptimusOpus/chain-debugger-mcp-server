// Skipping WebSocket tests due to complexity of timing, reconnection, and message routing logic.
// Plan: use fake timers and a mocked WebSocket implementation to test:
//  - connectWebSocket() success, timeouts, and reconnection backoff
//  - subscribe/unsubscribe flows with message correlation by request id
//  - resubscribeAll() after reconnect and callback delivery
//  - SubscriptionLimitError when exceeding max subscriptions
// For now, HTTP and operation wrapper coverage is prioritized per testing plan.
