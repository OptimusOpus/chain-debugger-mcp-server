# Tenderly + EVM RPC MCP Server

A unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that combines:
- **Tenderly Integration**: Read-only access to Tenderly's blockchain monitoring and alert system
- **Generic EVM RPC Support**: Direct interaction with any EVM-compatible blockchain via JSON-RPC

This server enables AI assistants to both monitor blockchain activity through Tenderly and interact directly with EVM chains through a standardized protocol.

## What is This?

This server creates a bridge between AI tools and blockchain data through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing AI assistants like Claude to:

**Tenderly Features:**
- **List all alerts** from your Tenderly project
- **Retrieve specific alerts** by ID with full details
- **Analyze blockchain monitoring data** to provide insights and recommendations
- **Simulate transactions** using Tenderly's powerful simulation engine

**EVM RPC Features:**
- **Execute any JSON-RPC method** on EVM-compatible chains
- **Query blockchain data** directly (balances, transactions, blocks, etc.)
- **Support for custom/new chains** via configurable RPC endpoints
- **Chain-specific features** (e.g., Zircuit quarantine functions)

### Key Features

- üîí **Read-only access** - Only retrieves data, never modifies anything
- üöÄ **Zero-configuration MCP server** - Works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant
- üìä **Rich alert data** - Access to alert expressions, delivery channels, severity levels, and more
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation
- üîê **Secure** - Environment-based credential management, no hardcoded secrets

## Requirements

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Tenderly account with API access
- Valid Tenderly credentials (account slug, project ID, and access token)
- (Optional) EVM RPC endpoint URL for direct blockchain access

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the environment example file and configure your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   # Tenderly Configuration (Required)
   TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=your-account-slug
   TENDERLY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   TENDERLY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
   
   # EVM RPC Configuration (Optional)
   EVM_RPC_URL=https://eth.llamarpc.com
   EVM_CHAIN_NAME=Ethereum
   ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
   ANALYTICS_DB_PATH=./analytics.db
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Start the MCP server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server communicates via stdio (standard input/output) as per the MCP specification. It will log startup messages to stderr and wait for MCP protocol messages on stdin.

You can also pass EVM RPC configuration via command line arguments:
```bash
npm start -- --rpc-url https://mainnet.zircuit.com --chain-name Zircuit --analytics
```

### Using with AI Assistants

Once running, AI assistants can interact with your Tenderly project through these capabilities:

**Available Resources:**
- `tenderly://alerts` - Returns a JSON list of all alerts from your Tenderly project
- `tenderly://simulations` - Access to Tenderly transaction simulations
- `evm://rpc_info` - Information about the current EVM RPC connection (if configured)
- `evm://chain_info` - Chain ID and network details (if configured)

**Available Tools:**
- `get_alert_by_id(id: string)` - Retrieves detailed information about a specific alert
- `simulate_transaction(...)` - Simulate transactions using Tenderly
- `eth_json_rpc_call(method, params)` - Execute any Ethereum JSON-RPC method (if EVM RPC configured)
- `zirc_isQuarantined(transactionHash)` - Check transaction quarantine status (Zircuit only)
- `zirc_getQuarantined(address?)` - Get quarantined transactions (Zircuit only)

### Example Interactions

When connected to an AI assistant, you can ask questions like:

**Tenderly-related:**
- *"What alerts do I have in my Tenderly project?"*
- *"Show me the details for alert ID abc123"*
- *"Which alerts are currently enabled?"* 
- *"What are the most severe alerts I should be concerned about?"*
- *"Simulate a transaction that transfers 1 ETH from address A to address B"*

**EVM RPC-related:**
- *"What's the current block number?"*
- *"Check the ETH balance of 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"*
- *"Get the transaction receipt for 0x5c504ed432cb51138bcf09aa5e8a410dd4a1e204ef84bfed1be16dfba1b22060"*
- *"Execute eth_getCode for the USDC contract"*
- *"Is transaction 0xabc... quarantined?"* (Zircuit only)

The AI assistant will use this server to fetch the data and provide intelligent analysis of your blockchain interactions.

### Development & Testing

You can use the MCP Inspector to test the server:

```bash
# Build and inspect the server
make inspect
```

This opens a web interface where you can test the MCP resources and tools directly.

## Technical Details

### MCP Resources and Tools

**Resources:**
- `tenderly://alerts` - Returns a comprehensive list of all alerts from your Tenderly project, including:
  - Alert IDs, names, and descriptions
  - Enabled/disabled status
  - Alert expressions and conditions
  - Delivery channels configuration
  - Severity levels and color coding
  - Creation and modification timestamps

**Tools:**
- `get_alert(id: string)` - Retrieves detailed information about a specific alert by its ID

### Data Schema

Alerts returned by this server include:
- **Basic Info**: ID, name, description, enabled status
- **Expressions**: Alert trigger conditions and logic
- **Delivery Channels**: How and where alerts are sent
- **Metadata**: Project ID, timestamps, severity, color coding
- **Permissions**: Whether the alert is editable by your API token

### Architecture

```
AI Assistant  ‚Üî  MCP Protocol  ‚Üî  Tenderly MCP Server  ‚Üî  Tenderly API
```

The server acts as a secure proxy, translating MCP requests into Tenderly API calls and formatting responses according to the MCP specification.

## Configuration Limitations

Please note the following limitations regarding configurations in this MCP server:

- **Single `.env` File**: The server loads environment variables from a single `.env` file. Multiple `.env` files cannot be active simultaneously. To use different configurations, you must switch `.env` files or override variables via command-line arguments.
- **Single Chain Connection**: The server connects to one EVM RPC endpoint at a time per instance. Simultaneous connections to multiple chains are not supported in a single server instance, though future updates plan to address this.
- **RAG/Memory Configuration**: Only one memory store configuration (`ENABLE_MEMORY` and `MEMORY_STORE_PATH`) is active per server instance. Multiple memory configurations are not supported.
- **Analytics Configuration**: Similarly, only one analytics configuration (`ENABLE_ANALYTICS` and `ANALYTICS_DB_PATH`) is active per instance.

To work with different configurations for any of these features, you can run multiple server instances with distinct `.env` files or command-line overrides.
