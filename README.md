- **Granular alert inspection** - Deep-dive into specific alerts by ID with comprehensive details
- **Advanced monitoring analytics** - Process blockchain monitoring data for actionable insights
- **Transaction simulation engine** - Leverage Tenderly's sophisticated simulation capabilities

**EVM RPC Capabilities:**
- **Universal JSON-RPC execution** - Run any standard or custom RPC method across EVM networks
- **Direct blockchain querying** - Access balances, transactions, blocks, and contract data natively
- **Multi-chain architecture** - Configurable endpoints supporting diverse EVM-compatible networks
- **Specialized chain functions** - Enhanced features for specific networks (Zircuit quarantine system, etc.)

### Core Architecture Features

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ runtime environment
- Active Tenderly account with API privileges
- Tenderly authentication credentials (account slug, project identifier, access token)
- Optional: EVM RPC endpoint URL for direct blockchain connectivity

## Installation & Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local environment
2. Install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Initialize your environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Configure your `.env` file with the following parameters:
   ```
   # Tenderly Configuration (Required)
   TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=your-account-slug
   TENDERLY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   TENDERLY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
   
   # EVM RPC Configuration (Optional)
   EVM_RPC_URL=https://eth.llamarpc.com
   EVM_CHAIN_NAME=Ethereum
   ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
   ANALYTICS_DB_PATH=./analytics.db
   ```
5. Compile the TypeScript project:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

## Usage

### Server Execution

Launch the MCP server:
```bash
pnpm start
```

The server operates through stdio (standard input/output) communication following MCP specification standards. Initialization logs output to stderr while the server awaits MCP protocol messages via stdin.

For dynamic EVM RPC configuration, command-line arguments are supported:
```bash
pnpm start -- --rpc-url https://mainnet.zircuit.com --chain-name Zircuit --analytics
```

### AI Assistant Integration

Once operational, AI assistants gain access to your Tenderly infrastructure through the following capabilities:

**Resource Endpoints:**
- `tenderly://alerts` - Complete JSON enumeration of all project alerts with metadata
- `tenderly://simulations` - Direct access to Tenderly's transaction simulation infrastructure  
- `evm://rpc_info` - Current EVM RPC connection status and configuration details
- `evm://chain_info` - Network identification and chain-specific metadata

**Functional Tools:**
- `get_alert_by_id(id: string)` - Detailed alert retrieval with comprehensive metadata
- `simulate_transaction(...)` - Advanced transaction simulation via Tenderly's engine
- `eth_json_rpc_call(method, params)` - Universal Ethereum JSON-RPC method execution
- `zirc_isQuarantined(transactionHash)` - Zircuit-specific transaction quarantine status checking
- `zirc_getQuarantined(address?)` - Quarantined transaction enumeration for Zircuit network

### Practical Use Cases

With the server connected to an AI assistant, you can perform queries such as:

**Tenderly Operations:**
- *"Enumerate all alerts configured in my Tenderly project"*
- *"Provide comprehensive details for alert ID abc123"*
- *"Identify which alerts are currently active and operational"* 
- *"Analyze the most critical alerts requiring immediate attention"*
- *"Execute a simulation for a 1 ETH transfer between specified addresses"*

**EVM RPC Operations:**
- *"Retrieve the current blockchain height"*
- *"Query ETH balance for address 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"*
- *"Fetch transaction receipt for hash 0x5c504ed432cb51138bcf09aa5e8a410dd4a1e204ef84bfed1be16dfba1b22060"*
- *"Extract bytecode from the USDC contract address"*
- *"Verify quarantine status for transaction 0xabc..."* (Zircuit-specific)

The AI assistant leverages this server to retrieve blockchain data and deliver sophisticated analysis of your on-chain activities.

### Development & Testing

The MCP Inspector provides comprehensive server testing capabilities:

```bash
# Build and launch inspection interface
make inspect
```

This launches a web-based interface enabling direct testing of all MCP resources and tools.

## Technical Architecture

### MCP Resource & Tool Implementation

**Resource Infrastructure:**
- `tenderly://alerts` - Comprehensive alert enumeration from your Tenderly project, including:
  - Complete alert metadata (IDs, names, descriptions)
  - Operational status indicators (enabled/disabled states)
  - Alert expression logic and trigger conditions
  - Delivery channel configurations and routing
  - Severity classification and visual coding
  - Temporal metadata (creation and modification timestamps)

**Tool Framework:**
- `get_alert(id: string)` - Granular alert data retrieval with complete metadata extraction

### Data Structure Design

The server returns structured alert data containing:
- **Core Attributes**: Unique identifiers, names, descriptions, operational status
- **Logic Components**: Trigger expressions, conditional logic, evaluation criteria
- **Distribution Configuration**: Delivery mechanisms, routing destinations, notification channels  
- **System Metadata**: Project associations, temporal markers, severity indicators, visual classifications
- **Access Control**: API token permissions and modification privileges

### System Architecture

```
AI Assistant  ‚Üî  MCP Protocol  ‚Üî  Chain Debugger MCP Server  ‚Üî  Tenderly API
```

The server operates as a secure intermediary proxy, handling MCP request translation to Tenderly API calls while ensuring response formatting adheres to MCP specification requirements.

## Configuration Constraints

The current implementation operates within these architectural boundaries:

- **Environment Configuration**: Single `.env` file support per instance. Multi-environment configurations require separate `.env` files or command-line parameter overrides for different deployment scenarios.
- **Network Connectivity**: One EVM RPC endpoint per server instance. Multi-chain simultaneous connections require separate server instances, though future architectural enhancements will address this limitation.
- **Memory Store Configuration**: Single memory store configuration (`ENABLE_MEMORY` and `MEMORY_STORE_PATH`) per instance. Multiple memory backends are not currently supported within a single process.
- **Analytics Configuration**: One analytics configuration set (`ENABLE_ANALYTICS` and `ANALYTICS_DB_PATH`) per server instance.

For diverse configuration requirements across these features, deploy multiple server instances with distinct configuration profiles or command-line parameter sets.
