# RAG/Memory Integration Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a plan to integrate a simple but useful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component into the MCP server. This will provide the server with a memory capability, allowing it to store and retrieve information from past interactions, documentation, or other text-based data sources to provide more context-aware and accurate responses.

We will leverage existing open-source libraries to avoid building a new system from scratch.

## 2. Proposed Technology Stack

-   **RAG Framework**: `LangChain.js`
    -   **Reasoning**: It is a popular and comprehensive library for building applications with LLMs. It provides all the necessary components for a RAG pipeline, including document loaders, text splitters, and integrations with embedding models and vector stores.

-   **Vector Store**: `Vectra`
    -   **Reasoning**: `Vectra` is a lightweight, local, file-based vector database for Node.js. It requires no separate server or infrastructure, making it easy to integrate directly into the existing project. Data will be stored locally in a specified directory.

-   **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (or similar)
    -   **Reasoning**: This is a high-quality, efficient model for creating text embeddings. It can be used locally via `LangChain.js` integrations, ensuring all data processing can happen within the project's environment.

## 3. Integration Steps

1.  **Add Dependencies**: Install the required npm packages: `langchain`, `vectra`, and a library for using sentence-transformers (e.g., `@xenova/transformers`).

2.  **Create a Memory Service**: 
    -   Create a new directory `src/memory/`.
    -   Inside, create a `MemoryService.ts` class. This service will encapsulate all the RAG logic, including:
        -   Initializing the `Vectra` vector store in a local directory (e.g., `./memory_store`).
        -   Loading and processing documents (e.g., from `.md` files, or plain text).
        -   Creating and storing vector embeddings.
        -   Executing similarity searches to retrieve relevant information.

3.  **Implement Memory Operations**: 
    -   Create a new file `src/operations/memory.ts`.
    -   Define new MCP operations to interact with the `MemoryService`, such as:
        -   `memory_addDocument`: An operation to add a new document (e.g., a file path or text content) to the memory.
        -   `memory_query`: An operation to ask a question and retrieve the most relevant information from the memory.

4.  **Update Server Configuration**: 
    -   Modify `src/config.ts` to include any necessary configuration for the memory service, such as the path to the vector store directory.

5.  **Integrate into Server**: 
    -   Update `src/index.ts` to initialize the `MemoryService` and register the new memory operations.

## 4. Example Use Case

Once integrated, the memory could be used to make the MCP server more knowledgeable about its own projects. For example:

1.  The `MEGAETH_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` file could be added to the memory using the `memory_addDocument` operation.
2.  A user could then ask, "What is the plan for MegaETH integration?"
3.  The MCP server would use the `memory_query` operation to retrieve the relevant sections from the plan and formulate an accurate answer.

This approach provides a powerful, self-contained memory solution without adding significant external dependencies or infrastructure complexity.
